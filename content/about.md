Hey &#128515;,

My name is SÃ¼mer Cip. I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at [blackfire.io](https://blackfire.io). I have been coding nearly whole my life and worked for various companies for different Software Engineering roles. Visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumer-cip/) for more information. I have tried my best to contribute to various Open Source projects whenever possible, most notably: [Yappi](https://github.com/sumerc/yappi). I have always had a passion for developing tools to simplify/optimize systems. These days, I am mainly interested in <b>Observability</b>, <b>Database internals</b>, <b>Low-level security</b>, <b>Go</b>, <b>Python</b>.

I am a father of two little monsters and play Squash occasionally.

This is my personal blog in which I write about random stuff that interests me.

You can [contact](mailto:sumerc@gmail.com) me if you like.
