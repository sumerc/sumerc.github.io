Hey &#128515;,

My name is <b>SÃ¼mer Cip</b>, and I am  a Senior Software Engineer at [blackfire.io](https://blackfire.io). I have been coding for more than <b>20 years</b> both professionally and un-professionally and worked for various companies for different <b>Software Engineering</b> roles. I have contributed to various <b>open source</b> projects. (most notably: [Yappi](https://github.com/sumerc/yappi)) and have always had a passion for developing tools to simplify/optimize systems.
These days, I am mainly interested in <b>Observability</b>, <b>Low-level security</b>, <b>Go</b>, <b>Python</b> and have mixed feelings about <b>Rust</b>.

This is my personal blog in which I write about random stuff that interests me.
