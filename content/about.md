Hey &#128515;,

My name is SÃ¼mer Cip. I have been coding roughly my whole life and have worked for various companies in different Software Engineering roles. Visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumer-cip/) for more information. I have tried my best to contribute to various Open Source projects whenever possible, most notably [Yappi](https://github.com/sumerc/yappi). I have always been passionate about developing tools to simplify/optimize systems. These days, I am mainly interested in <b>Observability</b>, <b>Distributed Systems</b>, <b>Database internals</b>, <b>Low-level security</b>, <b>Go</b> and <b>Python</b>.

I am the father of three little monsters, and I play Squash and run occasionally.

This is my personal blog, where I write about random stuff that interests me.

You can [contact](mailto:sumerc@gmail.com) me if you like.
