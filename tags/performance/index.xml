&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://sumercip.com/yess.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Python 3.11, there has been a strong, ongoing effort to make Python faster, and the results are clear. Performance improvements are real, and the work continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s both refreshing and surprising to see such significant speed gains in a language that&amp;rsquo;s nearly 30 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog post for years. I have been finding excuses for not writing one over
the years, but I feel this is the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was coding as usual when I started something odd with my shell. I have done few adjustments
to my &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file and out of a sudden it became very slow to spawn a new shell. As a person
who has a obsession with performance, it became my duty to find out the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
