It includes powerful and opinionated(!) profilers inside the runtime. Other languages like Ruby, Python, or Node.js, contains profilers or a few APIs for writing profilers. But they are limited in scope compared to what Go offers out of the box. If you want to learn more about the types of observability tools that Go provides, I highly recommend Felix GeisendÃ¶rfer&amp;rsquo;s The Busy Developer&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Go Profiling, Tracing and Observability</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://sumercip.com/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 17:47:24 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sumercip.com/about/</guid><description>Hey ðŸ˜ƒ,
My name is SÃ¼mer Cip. I have been coding nearly whole my life and worked for various companies for different Software Engineering roles. Visit my LinkedIn profile for more information. I have tried my best to contribute to various Open Source projects whenever possible, most notably: Yappi. I have always had a passion for developing tools to simplify/optimize systems. These days, I am mainly interested in Observability, Database internals, Low-level security, Go, Python.</description></item><item><title>Improve zsh startup time via lazyload</title><link>https://sumercip.com/posts/lazyload-zsh/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 11:29:57 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sumercip.com/posts/lazyload-zsh/</guid><description>My shell is slooow! This is my first blog post for years. I have been finding excuses for not writing one over the years, but I feel this is the right time.
I was coding as usual when I started something odd with my shell. I have done few adjustments to my .zshrc file and out of a sudden it became very slow to spawn a new shell. As a person who has a obsession with performance, it became my duty to find out the problem.</description></item><item><title>Articles</title><link>https://sumercip.com/articles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sumercip.com/articles/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
