&lt;p>I have also written some articles and blog posts mostly related to my work:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Inside the Go CPU profiler</title><link>https://sumercip.com/posts/inside-the-go-cpu-profiler/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2022 18:42:25 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sumercip.com/posts/inside-the-go-cpu-profiler/</guid><description>&lt;p>Go is one of its kind when it comes to profiling. It includes powerful and opinionated(!) profilers inside the runtime. Other languages like
Ruby, Python, or Node.js, contains profilers or a few APIs for writing profilers. But they are limited in scope compared to what Go offers out of the box. If you want to learn more about the types of observability tools that Go provides, I highly recommend Felix GeisendÃ¶rfer&amp;rsquo;s

&lt;p>My name is SÃ¼mer Cip. I have been coding roughly my whole life and have worked for various companies in different Software Engineering roles. Visit my &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumer-cip/">LinkedIn profile&lt;/a> for more information. I have tried my best to contribute to various Open Source projects whenever possible, most notably &lt;a href="https://github.com/sumerc/yappi">Yappi&lt;/a>. I have always been passionate about developing tools to simplify/optimize systems. These days, I am mainly interested in &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Observability&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Distributed Systems&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Database internals&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Low-level security&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Go&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> and &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Python&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improve zsh startup time via lazyload</title><link>https://sumercip.com/posts/lazyload-zsh/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 11:29:57 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sumercip.com/posts/lazyload-zsh/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="my-shell-is-slooow">My shell is slooow!&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This is my first blog post for years. I have been finding excuses for not writing one over
the years, but I feel this is the right time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was coding as usual when I started something odd with my shell. I have done few adjustments
to my &lt;code>.zshrc&lt;/code> file and out of a sudden it became very slow to spawn a new shell. As a person
who has a obsession with performance, it became my duty to find out the problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Articles</title><link>https://sumercip.com/articles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sumercip.com/articles/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
